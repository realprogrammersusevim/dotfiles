# dotfiles

These are my configuration files for Neovim, Zsh, gitui, kitty, SketchyBar,
skhd, yabai, and my browser new tab page. Above all, please do not just copy and
paste them into your own configuration files. They are meant to be used as
inspiration for your own configuration. Your tools should reflect your own
needs, not mine.

## Usage

Explanations and usage instructions are provided in the README files of each
folder.

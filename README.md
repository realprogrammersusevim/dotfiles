These are my configuration files for Zsh and NeoVim. Above all, please do not just copy and paste them into your own configuration files. They are meant to be used as inspiration for your own configuration. Your tools should reflect your own needs, not mine.

My NeoVim configuration uses LunarVim to set up a lot of the options that I already would have wanted but gets them working far better than I ever could have. Beyond that, I added a few of my own finishing touches to mold it into exactly the tool that I want.

Finally, if you don't understand how to use a certain config option just Google it or open an issue.

# dotfiles

These are my configuration files for Neovim, ZSH, gitui, kitty, SketchyBar,
skhd, yabai, and GhosTTY. Above all, please do not just copy and paste them into
your own configuration files. They are meant to be used as inspiration for your
own configuration. Your tools should reflect your own needs, not mine.

## Usage

Explanations and usage instructions are provided in the README files of each
folder.

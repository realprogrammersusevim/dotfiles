# dotfiles
These are my configuration files for Zsh and NeoVim. Above all, please do not just copy and paste them into your own configuration files. They are meant to be used as inspiration for your own configuration. Your tools should reflect your own needs, not mine.

Also not that several of the config options in my init.vim will only work in NeoVim and not Vim.

Finally, if you don't understand how to use a certain config option just Google it.

[Neovim config](https://github.com/realprogrammersusevim/dotfiles/nvim)

These are my configuration files for Zsh, gitui, and my browser new tab page.
Above all, please do not just copy and paste them into your own configuration
files. They are meant to be used as inspiration for your own configuration. Your
tools should reflect your own needs, not mine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Move the files in the `zsh/` folder to your home directory
3. Install zplug and oh-my-zsh
4. Run `$ zplug install`
5. Install the LSPs, formatters, and diagnostics with `:Mason`
6. Use the `browser/new_tab.html` page as your new tab page in your browser

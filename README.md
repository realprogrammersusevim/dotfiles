[Neovim config](https://github.com/realprogrammersusevim/dotfiles/tree/main/nvim)

These are my configuration files for Neovim, Zsh, gitui, and my browser new tab
page. Above all, please do not just copy and paste them into your own
configuration files. They are meant to be used as inspiration for your own
configuration. Your tools should reflect your own needs, not mine.

## Installation

All these configurations can go in your `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. The browser new tab
page can be used with a browser or extension that supports custom new tab pages.

# kitty

## What is this?

[Kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) is a cross-platform, fast, feature-rich, GPU based terminal. This is my
config file and color schemes.

## How can I use it?

Move the `kitty` directory into your `~/.config` directory. Then, you can
install the Kitty app and it should pick up the config file automatically.

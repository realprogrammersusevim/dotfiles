# GhosTTY Configuration

Configuration file for the [GhosTTY](https://ghostty.org/) terminal. The
terminal is designed to be nearly zero-config, so not many options need to be
set or toyed with.

## How can I use it?

Install the GhosTTY terminal and move the config file to the
`~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/` directory.

# Zsh

## What is this?

These are my configuration files for Zsh. I use them on my Mac.

## How can I use it?

Zsh comes pre-installed on many systems, but if you don't have it go ahead and
install it. I also use [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) and
[zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug) which you will need to install. The
files in this directory are meant to be placed in your home directory. Many of
the path settings are specific to my system, so you will need to change or
delete many of them.

# Zsh

## What is this?

These are my configuration files for Zsh. I use them on my Mac.

## How can I use it?

Zsh comes pre-installed on many systems, but if you don't have it go ahead and
install it. I also use [antidote](https://github.com/mattmc3/antidote) as my
plugin manager which you will need to install. The files in this directory are
meant to be placed in your home directory. Many of the path settings are
specific to my system, so you will need to change or delete many of them.
